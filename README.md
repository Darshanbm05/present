# KSRTC Bus Info

A full-stack web application built to simplify access to KSRTC unreserved bus schedules by transforming publicly available PDF timetable data into a searchable, user-friendly web interface.

This project aims to solve a real-world usability problem where bus schedule information is available only in static PDF formats on official portals.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

KSRTC unreserved bus schedules are published in PDF format, which makes:

- Searching by route difficult  
- Filtering time-consuming  
- Mobile usage inconvenient  
- Data updates non-interactive  

This project converts static schedule data into a dynamic and searchable web application.

- 🚌 Search all buses from a specific bus stand
- ⏰ 24-hour time formatted schedule display
- 📍 Structured route details (via places, service number, bus type)
- 📝 Contribution system for requesting schedule updates
- 📱 Fully responsive (mobile + desktop optimized)
- ⚡ Fast client-side experience using Vite

## 🗄 Data Handling

Schedule data is extracted from publicly available PDF timetables.

Data is cleaned and normalized before insertion.

Time values are converted to proper HH:MM 24-hour format.

Route names are standardized using uppercase normalization.

Bus stand-based search structure is implemented for accurate filtering.


## 📝 Contribution System

Users can:

- Request addition of missing schedules
- Suggest updates for incorrect data

Requests are stored in a separate collection and can be reviewed before approval.
