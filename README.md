KSRTC Bus Info

A full-stack web application built to simplify access to KSRTC unreserved bus schedules by transforming publicly available PDF timetable data into a searchable, user-friendly web interface.

This project aims to solve a real-world usability problem where bus schedule information is available only in static PDF formats on official portals.

🚀 Problem Statement

KSRTC unreserved bus schedules are published in PDF format, which makes:

Searching by route difficult

Filtering time-consuming

Mobile usage inconvenient

Data updates non-interactive

This project converts static schedule data into a dynamic and searchable web application.

🎯 Features

🔎 Search buses by route (From → To)

🚌 Search all buses from a specific bus stand

⏰ 24-hour time formatted schedule display

📍 Structured route details (via places, service number, bus type)

📝 Contribution system for requesting schedule updates

📱 Fully responsive (mobile + desktop optimized)

⚡ Fast client-side experience using Vite
